## TriviaCrack/Duolingo for Developers

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/lambda](https://assembly.com/lambda).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.

## How to Contribute

To contribute to the project, find an open bounty at [https://assembly.com/lambda/bounties] (bounties for the iOS project will be tagged with IOS). You will probably want to Make sure the bounty is assigned to you before beginning work! Please create a feature branch with a name that references the bounty number you are working on (ex. BXXX - Fix bug...). When you have completed the work, issue a pull request and someone will review the code. Once the pull request is accepted and merged, you will be awarded the bounty on the assembly.com website.

Issues in this github project that we have decided to address will correspond to bounties on the assembly website. If you find an open issue without a bounty, please notify someone in the chat on the project's assembly page.

Smaller pull requests will be accepted more quickly! Please stick to one pull request per issue/bounty. Pull requests that cover multiple bounties will probably be rejected outright. Focus on solving just the problem in the issue/bounty.

## Language and Style guide

This iOS project is written in Swift. We are currently following the github Swift style guide located at [https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide], though this is very likely to change.
